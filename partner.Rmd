I was able to open and knit the owner's file.

My tip would be to separate was is a command and what isn't when listing the steps. Also there seemed to be a lot of supplemental information on the slides, which I am sure will be useful in the future, but it was a bit overwhelming at first. I also was confused about what the difference between a repository and a directory was. One way I remember what the remote repository is is an online file sharing space, where you can access files on multiple devices.
